# Advanced Calculator

This is an advanced calculator project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features basic arithmetic operations, scientific functions, memory storage, keyboard input support, and more. The calculator is designed to provide a real-life experience, complete with a responsive layout that centers on the webpage and various customization options.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Modulo.
- **Scientific Functions**: Includes operations like square root, power, trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), logarithms, exponential, factorial, and more.
- **Memory Functions**: Memory Clear (MC), Memory Recall (MR), Memory Add (M+), and Memory Subtract (M-).
- **Keyboard Input Support**: Users can input numbers, operators, and commands via keyboard, including the `Enter` key to evaluate expressions.
- **Scientific Function Toggle**: Show or hide scientific functions using the `SCF` button.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes.
- **Rounding**: Round the current value to the nearest whole number.
- **Vibration Feedback**: Provides vibration feedback on compatible devices.
- **History Toggle**: Show or hide the calculation history.
